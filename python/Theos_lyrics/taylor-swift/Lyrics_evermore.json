Well\n\nOoh\nI guess I'll never know\nOoh\nAnd you'll go on with the show\n\nBut it's never too late to come back to my side\nThe stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo\nAnd if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know\nYou know, you'll always know me\nDorothea, uh-uh\nDorothea, ah-ah\n\nOoh, ooh\nOoh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nOoh, ooh\nOoh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh\nDorothea (Ah-ah-ah)\nAh-ah\nOoh50Embed"
