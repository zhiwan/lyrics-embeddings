(Hold on)\nYes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)\nYes, yes, I can see it\nYes, yes, I can see it now45Embed"

Promise me this\nThat you'll stand by me forever\nBut if, God forbid, fate should step in\nAnd force us into a goodbye\nIf you have children some day\nWhen they point to the pictures\nPlease, tell 'em my name\nTell 'em how the crowds went wild\nTell 'em how I hope they shine\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nI had the time of my life with you\nLong, long live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nAnd I was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid\nSinging, \"Long live all the mountains we moved\"\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nAnd long, long live that look on your face\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered35Embed"
