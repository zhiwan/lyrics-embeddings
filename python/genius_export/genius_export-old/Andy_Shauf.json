It seems to me\nAll he ever does is bring you down.\"\n\nI'm spilling my drink as I really start\nTearing one of my best friends apart\nShe's getting uneasy and my drunken speech\nEnds as my hand finds its way to hers\nI say, \"You know I've never really met someone like you.\"\n\"You know I've never really met someone like you.\"\nSee Andy Shauf LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also likeJeremy walks over and, to my surprise\nSherry puts her arm around his side2Embed"
