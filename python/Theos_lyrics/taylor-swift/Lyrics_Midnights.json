Can it?\n\nAre we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)\nWeird, but fuckin' beautiful\nFlying in a dream (Flying in a dream)\nStars by the pocketful\nYou wanting me (You wanting me)\nTonight feels impossible\nBut it's comin' down\nNo sound, it's all around\n\nLike snow on the beach (Snow on the beach)\nLike snow on the beach (Flying in a dream)\nLike snow on the beach (You wanting me)\nLike snow, ah\nBut it's comin' down\nNo sound, it's all around\n\nLike snow on the beach\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\nLike snow on the beach\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)37Embed"

Oh\nDid you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh\nWhen she said it was too much?\nDo you wish you could still touch her?\nIt's just a question\nYou might also like\nHalf-moon eyes, bad surprise\nDid you realize out of time?\nShe was on your mind with some dickhead guy\nThat you saw that night\nBut you were on somethin'\nIt was one drink after another\nFuckin' politics and gender roles\nAnd you're not sure and I don't know\nGot swept away in the gray\nI just may like to have a conversation\n\nCan I ask you a question?\nDid you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room\nAnd every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you\nBut fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?\nThen what did you do?\nDid you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh\nDid you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh\nWhen she said it was too much?\nDo you wish you could still touch her?\nIt's just a question\n\nDoes it feel like everything's just like\nSecond best after that meteor strike?\nAnd what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?\nThat's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable\nAnd right, but tonight\nCan I ask you a question?

(Huh)\nI can reclaim the land\nAnd I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)\nYou might also like\nBest believe I'm still bejeweled\nWhen I walk in the room\nI can still make the whole place shimmer\nAnd when I meet the band\nThey ask, \"Do you have a man?\"\nI could still say, \"I don't remember\"\nFamiliarity breeds contempt\nDon't put me in the basement\nWhen I want the penthouse of your heart\nDiamonds in my eyes\nI polish up real, I polish up real nice\n\nNice\n\nSapphire tears on my face\nSadness became my whole sky\nBut some guy said my aura's moonstone\nJust 'cause he was high\nAnd we're dancin' all night\nAnd you can try to change my mind\nBut you might have to wait in line\nWhat's a girl gonna do?\nA diamond's gotta shine\nBest believe I'm still bejeweled\nWhen I walk in the room\nI can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)\nAnd when I meet the band\nThey ask, \"Do you have a man?\"\nI could still say, \"I don't remember\"\nFamiliarity breeds contempt\nDon't put me in the basement\nWhen I want the penthouse of your heart\nDiamonds in my eyes\nI polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice\n\nAnd we're dancin' all night\nAnd you can try to change my mind\nBut you might have to wait in line\nWhat's a girl gonna do?
