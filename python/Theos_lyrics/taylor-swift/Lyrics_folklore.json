Will you love me?\nWill you kiss me on the porch\nIn front of all your stupid friends?\nIf you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?\nWill it patch your broken wings?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\n\nStanding in your cardigan\nKissin' in my car again\nStopped at a streetlight\nYou know I miss you94Embed"
